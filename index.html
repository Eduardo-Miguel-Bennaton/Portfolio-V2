                                <p>Born on July 16th, 2004, I was raised, and educated in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. I grew up in a family of 3 (including me), 
                                    and spent the majority of my life going to school and participating in multi-cultural events that flourished my education.</p>
                                <p>When I turned 17, I began to pursue a better formation abroad. I flew to Cloppenburg, Germany on September 31st, where I would 
                                    spend one year studying German at Liebfrauenschule as an exchange student.</p>

                                <p>I am very passionate when it comes to art. I love putting effort into everything I do, even if it's something simple.</p>
                                <p>I enjoy playing and listening to music daily. From time to time, I also draw and write often to keep my calligraphy and drawing techniques intact.</p>
                                <p>Overall, I enjoy learning and analyzing my daily doings to give the best of myself.</p>
                                <p>What can I say, a little goes a long way!</p>

                                <p>Ironically enough, I have been very passionate since youth for coding. It allowed me to expand my view of what I was truly capable of doing with the little to no-knowledge 
                                I had. It has not been an easy road, but big things take time!</p>
                                <p class="bold">Nevertheless, it is rewarding.</p>
